Redacted Hub by Arizard.

*You are not permitted to upload this onto your server. This is for learning/critique purposes only. Also my code is very bad so please, if you're going to use it without my permission be very careful.*

It won't work anyway unless you patch all the references to my other addons. This will most likely never be released to the public because the coding is really dodgy.

##Adding jukebox songs/streams

1. Know lua table syntax
2. Create a pull request which adds your songs/streams to *jukebox_songs.lua* in the root directory of this repository
3. Songs must be a youtube link
4. Streams must be a .pls, .mp3, .m3u, .ogg URL
5. Check to make sure your song doesn't already exist
6. Wait for arizard to get off his ass and merge

##Understanding Items

Items are found in the folder *lua/autorun/hub/shop* in respective category folders. From here you can see crate item values which can be translated into percentages.
